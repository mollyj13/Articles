# Hello and welcome to the Articles course on Tapas Talk. 
### We hope you learn a lot about **A, An, & The**. 

## Let’s start with the indefinite articles - **a & an**. 
One reason **a & an** are the indefinite articles is because they show that the speaker doesn’t know how much of something there is. 

<mark>This reads awkwardly I want to make changes

>
For example: **“a car.”** 
Ok, whose car? How many cars? Because neither of us know anything about this car, we use the indefinite **a** article. 
>

The indefinite articles **a & an** also say that there is *something*, but we don’t know what that something is. Either we don’t have the item in front of us, or we have never seen it before. 

>
For example: 
I need **a** chair.	 
I need a chair, but I don’t know what it looks like or where one is. All I know is that I want *one* chair. 
>

Generally we use the **a** article with nouns that start with a consonant (any letter that’s not a vowel, so: <mark>insert a photo of the consonants). 

>
Examples: a coat, a table, a blanket.
>

Generally we use the **an** article with nouns that start with a vowel: <mark>insert a photo of the vowels<mark>

>
Examples: an apple, an office, an egg.
>

##Quiz:
###Choose the correct article for the following nouns:
A/An Bed	
**A
An** 

>
>**A** bed.

A/An Artichoke	
**A
An** 

>
>**An** artichoke

A/An Coat	
**A
An** 

>
>**A** coat.

A/An Office		
**A
An**

>
>**An** office.

A/An Egg	
**A
An**

>
>**An** egg.

## An or A?
Sometimes we use **an** with words that start with H. 

>
Examples: An historic moment, An hour, An honorable man. 
>

And sometimes we use **a** with words that start with H.

>
Examples: A house, A horse, A head.
>

The general rule of thumb is that if the beginning of the word starts with a vowel sound then we use **an** and if it starts with an “h” sound, we use **a**.

>
Example: hour <mark>(insert sound clip here)</mark>
Example: horse <mark>**(insert sound clip here)</mark>
>

## Only one of something
We can also use **a & an** to say that there is only one (1) of something. 

>
For example: “**an** apple”. 
How many apples are there? 1. 
>

<mark>Probably need more information here...</mark>

##Quiz:
###Can we use **a & an** with plural nouns (more than one thing: chairs, tables, dogs)? 	

<mark>This section needs more though on how to clearly delineate the different ways that people can choose based on their answers. </mark>

**Yes/No**

>
No→**a & an** are the singular indefinite articles they identify that the object is the only thing.
>

*Separating text*

>
Yes→ No link, because **a & an** are the singular indefinite articles they identify that the object is the only thing. 

>**The** is the definite article and tells us that both the speaker and the listener know of the object. 

>For example:“**The** apple is red.” Everyone knows which apple you are talking about. 

>How do they know which apple? Because the apple is the only apple you could be talking about OR everyone knows about the specific apple. 
>

###Can we use the to talk about things in general? Example: The elephants can swim well. 

**Yes/No/It depends**

>
>Yes. In this case, the speakers both know which things are in question so they can use **the**. 

>Example: While on safari two women say, “**The** elephants can swim well!” this is because both women know which elephants are currently swimming. 

>However, If you want to talk about all things, for example *every elephant that exists*, you can’t use **the** to describe all of those elephants. There’s too many elephants to use the definite article **the**. 
>

>No. If you want to talk about all things, for example *every elephant that exists*, you can’t use **the** to describe all of those elephants. There’s too many elephants to use the definite article **the**. 

>But, if the speakers both know which things are in question they can use **the**.

###Choose the correct answer for the following questions:

####The Switzerland is in Europe.

**An/No An**

An.
>
An. Yes! Very good. You are saying that you have more than one uncle but the listener doesn’t know which one, so you need an indefinite article.

Here you are clarifying which uncle→ the one who lives in San Francisco. 
>

No an.

>
No An  “I like to visit an uncle of mine.” You are saying that you have more than one uncle but the listener doesn’t know which one, so you need an indefinite article.
