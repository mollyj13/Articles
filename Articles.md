# Hello and welcome to the Articles course on Tapas Talk. 
### We hope you learn a lot about **A, An, & The**. 

## Let’s start with the indefinite articles - **a & an**. 
**A & an** are the indefinite articles. They show that the speaker doesn’t know how much of something there is. 

>
For example: **“a car.”**  
Ok, whose car? How many cars? Because neither of us know anything about this car, we use the indefinite **a** article. 
>

##Quiz
###Choose the correct article for the following nouns:
I have *A/two* bed.  	
**-A  
-Two** 

>
>**A** bed.

I want *A/two* car.  	
**-A  
-Two** 

>
>**A** car.

##Definite VS. Indefinite, Singular
We also use **a & an** to say that there is only one of something. 

>
For example: “**an** apple”. 
How many apples are there? 1. 
>

If the noun is plural (more than one thing: chairs, tables, dogs) we do *not* use **a** or **an**. 

>
For example: "Two dogs:.
There is more than one dog, so "two" describes the dogs. We don't need either **a** or **an**.
>

##Quiz
###Choose the correct article for the following nouns:
*A/No article* coat  
**-A  
-No article** 

>
>**A** coat.

*A/No article* phones  
**-A  
-No article**

>
>**No article** phones

## Consonants & Vowels
Generally we use the **an** article with nouns that start with a vowel. (insert a photo of the vowels)

>
Examples: an **a**pple, an **o**ffice, an **e**gg.
>

Generally we use the **a** article with nouns that start with a consonant. A consonant is any letter that’s not a vowel. (insert a photo of the consonants). 

>
Examples: a **c**oat, a **t**able, a **b**lanket.
>

##Quiz:
###Choose the correct article for the following nouns:
*A/An* office		
**A  
An**

>**An** office

*A/An* building  
**A  
An**

>
>**A** building

*A/An* egg	 
**A  
An**

>
>**An** egg

## An or A?
Sometimes we use **an** with words that start with H. 

>
Examples: An historic moment, An hour, An honorable man. 
>

And sometimes we use **a** with words that start with H.

>
Examples: A house, A horse, A head.
>

Generally if the beginning of the word starts with a vowel sound then we use **an** and if it starts with an “h” sound, we use **a**.

####Listen to the examples below. Can you hear the difference between the vowel sound and "h" sound?
>
Example: hour (insert sound clip here)  
Example: horse (insert sound clip here)
>

The follow section needs more though on how to clearly delineate the different ways that people can choose based on their answers.

##The
**The** is the definite article and tells us that both the speaker and the listener know of the object. 

>
For example:“**The** apple is red.”  
How do they know which apple? Because the apple is the only apple you could be talking about OR everyone knows about the specific apple. 
>

Can we use **the** to talk about things in general? 

>
For Example: The elephants can swim well.   
**Yes  
No  
It depends**
>

Separating text

>
>Yes. In this case, the speakers both know which things are in question so they can use **the**. 

>Example: While at the zoo with your friend, you say, “**The** elephants can swim well!” this is because both you and your friend know *which elephants* are currently swimming. 

>However, If you want to talk about all things, for example *every elephant that exists*, you can’t use **the** to describe all of those elephants. There’s too many elephants to use the definite article **the**. 
>

>
>No. If you want to talk about all things, for example *every elephant that exists*, you can’t use **the** to describe all of those elephants. There’s too many elephants to use the definite article **the**. 

>But, if both speakers know which things are in question they can use **the**. 

>Example: While at the zoo with your friend, you say, “**The** elephants can swim well!” this is because both you and your friend know *which elephants* are currently swimming.
