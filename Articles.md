# Hello and welcome to the Articles course on Tapas Talk. 
### We hope you learn a lot about **A, An, & The**. 

## When to us A vs. An
Generally we use the **an** article with nouns that start with a vowel. (insert a photo of the vowels)

>
Examples: an **a**pple, an **o**ffice, an **e**gg.
>

Generally we use the **a** article with nouns that start with a consonant. A consonant is any letter that’s not a vowel. (insert a photo of the consonants). 

>
Examples: a **c**oat, a **t**able, a **b**lanket.
>

##Quiz:

**A  
An**

>
>**A** building

*A/An* egg	 
**A  
An**

>
>**An** egg

## Special cases with "H" for an/a
Most of the time we use **an** with words that start with a silent H. 

>
Examples: An historic moment, An hour, An honorable man. (insert sound clip of each of these)
>

Most of the time we use **a** with words that start with H. In these cases, the H is pronounced.

>
Examples: A house, A horse, A head. (insert sound clip of each of these)
>

Generally if the beginning of the word starts with a vowel sound (silent H) then we use **an** and if it starts with an “h” sound, we use **a**. 

####Listen to the examples below. Can you hear the difference between the vowel sound and "h" sound?

Example: hour (insert sound clip here)

## Singular Indefinite Articles - **a & an** 
**A & an** are the indefinite articles. They show that the speaker hasn't identified a specific item. 

>
For example: **“a car.”**  
Ok, whose car? Which car? Because neither of us know anything about this car, we use the indefinite **a** article. 
>

We also use **a & an** to say that there is only one of something. 

>
For example: “**an** apple”. 
How many apples are there? 1. 
>

##Quiz
###Choose the correct article for the following nouns:
I have *a/two* bed.  	
**-A  
-Two** 

>
>**A** bed.

I want *an/two* orange.  	
**-An  
-Two** 

>
>**An** orange.

##Definite Article - **the**
**The** is the definite article and tells us that both the speaker and the listener know of the object. 

>
For example:“**The** apple is red.”  
How do they know which apple? Because the apple is the only apple you could be talking about and everyone knows which specific apple. 
>

##Quiz
###Choose the correct answer for the following questions:

Let's have dinner at **no article/the** table.

1. **A  
No article**

2. **A  
The**

>
>Yesterday I bought **a** puppy! **The** puppy is black.

##Plural Indefinite Articles - **an/a**
If the noun is plural (more than one thing: chairs, tables, dogs) generally we do *not* use **a** or **an**. 

>
For example: "Two dogs".
There is more than one dog, so "two" describes the dogs. We don't say "a two dogs".
>

We also do not usually use **a** or **an** with uncountable nouns. Here are some examples of uncountable nouns:

>
Water  
Music  
Furniture  
Rice 
None of these nouns has a plural form. 
>

##Plural Definite Article - **the**
Can we use **the** to talk about things in general? 

>
For Example: The elephants can swim well.   
**Yes  
No  
It depends**
>

YES

>
>Yes. In this case, the speakers both know which things are in question so they can use **the**. 

>Example: While at the zoo with your friend, you say, “**The** elephants can swim well!” this is because both you and your friend know *which elephants* are currently swimming. 

>However, If you want to talk about all things, for example *every elephant that exists*, you can’t use **the** to describe all of those elephants. There’s too many elephants to use the definite article **the**. 
>

NO

>
>No. If you want to talk about all things, for example *every elephant that exists*, you can’t use **the** to describe all of those elephants. There’s too many elephants to use the definite article **the**. 

>But, if both speakers know which things are in question they can use **the**. 

>Example: While at the zoo with your friend, you say, “**The** elephants can swim well!” this is because both you and your friend know *which elephants* are currently swimming.  
>

IT DEPENDS

>
It depends. If you want to talk about all things, for example *every elephant that exists*, you can’t use **the*. 

>But, if both speakers know which things are in question, they can use **the**. 

>Example: While at the zoo with your friend, you say, “**The** elephants can swim well!” this is because both you and your friend know *which elephants* are currently swimming.  

We also use **the** to talk about things that are part of everyday life. 

>
Example: The bus. 
Here we aren't talking about one specific bus, but a common experience that we all share. 
>
