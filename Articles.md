# Hello and welcome to the Articles course on Tapas Talk. 
### We hope you learn a lot about **A, An, & The**. 

## When to us A vs. An
Generally we use the **an** article with nouns that start with a vowel. (insert a photo of the vowels)

>
Examples: an **a**pple, an **o**ffice, an **e**gg.
>

Generally we use the **a** article with nouns that start with a consonant. A consonant is any letter that’s not a vowel. (insert a photo of the consonants). 

>
Examples: a **c**oat, a **t**able, a **b**lanket.
>

##Quiz:
###Choose the correct article for the following nouns:
*A/An* office		
**A  
An**

>**An** office

*A/An* building  
**A  
An**

>
>**A** building

*A/An* egg	 
**A  
An**

>
>**An** egg

## Special cases with "H" for an/a
Most of the time we use **an** with words that start with a silent H. 

>
Examples: An historic moment, An hour, An honorable man. (insert sound clip of each of these)
>

Most of the time we use **a** with words that start with H. In these cases, the H is pronounced.

>
Examples: A house, A horse, A head. (insert sound clip of each of these)
>

Generally if the beginning of the word starts with a vowel sound, because of the silent H, then we use **an** and if it starts with an “h” sound, we use **a**. 

####Listen to the examples below. Can you hear the difference between the vowel sound and "h" sound?
>
Example: hour (insert sound clip here)  
Example: horse (insert sound clip here)

## Singular Indefinite Articles - **a & an** 
**A & an** are the indefinite articles. They show that the speaker hasn't identified a specific item. 

>
For example: **“a car.”**  
Ok, whose car? Which car? Because neither of us know anything about this car, we use the indefinite **a** article. 
>

We also use **a & an** to say that there is only one of something. 

>
For example: “**an** apple”. 
How many apples are there? 1. 
>

##Quiz
###Choose the correct article for the following nouns:
I have *a/two* bed.  	
**-A  
-Two** 

>
>**A** bed.

I want *an/two* orange.  	
**-An  
-Two** 

>
>**An** orange.

##Definite Article - **the**
**The** is the definite article and tells us that both the speaker and the listener know of the object. 

>
For example:“**The** apple is red.”  
How do they know which apple? Because the apple is the only apple you could be talking about and everyone knows which specific apple. 
>

##Quiz
###Choose the correct answer for the following questions:

Let's have dinner at **no article/the** table.  
**-No article  
-The**

>
>Let's have dinner at **the** table.

1. **A

2. **A

>

**The/A** students are hard workers.   
**-The  
A**  

>
>**The** students are hard workers. 

##Plural Indefinite Articles - **an/a**
If the noun is plural (more than one thing: chairs, tables, dogs) generally we do *not* use **a** or **an**. 

>
For example: "Two dogs".
There is more than one dog, so "two" describes the dogs. We don't say "a two dogs".
>

We also do not usually use **a** or **an** with uncountable nouns. Uncountable nouns cannot be counted, therefore they don't need an article. Here are some examples of uncountable nouns:

>
Water  
Music  
Furniture  
Rice 
None of these nouns has a plural form. 
>

##Quiz
###Choose the correct article for the following nouns:
I went to the store to buy *A/No article* coat.  
**-A  
-No article** 

>
>I went to the store to buy **a** coat.

I went to the store to buy *A/No article* phones  
**-A  
-No article**

>
>I went to the store to buy **No article** phones

I went to the store to buy **-An/No article** rice  
**-An  
No article**

>
>I went to the store to buy **No article** rice

##Plural Definite Article - **the**
When we make generalizations about *all of something*, we don't use an article. 

>
For Example: Elephants are large. 
>

In this example, we are talking about EVERY elephant. We don't use an article because we can't know every single elephant in the whole world. 

We can, however, see a group of 1,000 elephants and say: **The** elephants are large! We can do this because we are making generalizations about a group of elephants that both the speaker and listener know.
